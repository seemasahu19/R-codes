#1. Create a numeric vector with elements 2,3,4,6.. call it as x

#2. Check the data type of a vector

#3. Check is datastructure is vector or not

#4. What is the length of the vector

#5. name the vector index as "One", "Two", "Three" and "Four"

#6. Create another vector with elements 'a','b' and 'c'.. call it as y

#7. Concatinate x and y and call the new data structure as z

#8. Check the data type of z

#9. Check if z is vector or not

#10. What is the length of z

#11. add each element of x with corresponding element of x only

#12. Multiply each elemnt of x with 5

#13. Fetch first element from x

#14. Fetch all elements except first from x.

#15. Fetch first and third elements together from x

#16. Create a vector with elements from 0 to 100 call it as a

#17. Fetch first 20 elements from a

#18. Fetch only those elements from a which are exactly divided by 10.

#1. Create a matrix 5X5 with randon numbers between 1 to 10, call it as m

#2. Fetch the element of 1st row and 2nd column

#3. Fetch the elements of 1st and 4th rows and 2nd and 4th column

#4. Add a column in the matrix with values 10,20,30,40,50 and make matrix 5X6

#5. Add a row in the matrix with values 10,20,30,40,50 and make matrix 6X6

#6. Name the row index as row1,row2,row3,row4,row5,row6

#7. Name the col index as col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,col6

#1. Create a list where first element is a vector (0 to 10), second element is a 3X3 matrix
# with randon numbers between 1 to 10, third elemnt is a inner list with two elements, both
# are 2X3 matrix with randon numbers between 1 to 10

#2. Rename the index as Vector, Matrix and List

#3. Update the 4th element of the list with value 100.

#4. Add the 4th elemnt as value 4 in list

#5. Delete the 4th element from the list
